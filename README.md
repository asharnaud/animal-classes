# Classes & Prototypes

> This is our Iron Yard homework in week 12. It is a project to work on object oriented programming in Javascript with the following deliverables:

* Create an Animal class with a constructor.
  * All Animals have a name and date of birth.
  * An Animals name might change, but not its date of birth.
  * All Animals should have a method for determining their age in years.
  * Create a toString() method which prints out the animals name and date of birth
* Create two specific species of Animal which extend the Animal class.
  * Specific species constructors MUST use the parent constructor.
  * Each species class must have a static method which returns the scientific name of that species.
  * If you create a mammal, it must be able to give birth.
  * If you create a reptile or bird it must be able to lay one or more eggs.
  * All species must re-implement the toString() method to print out what species it is.
